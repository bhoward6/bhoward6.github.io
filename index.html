    Most of my major accomplishments come from my time on the Hardin County High School bowling team. While I was on the team, I dedicated tons of
    time to perfecting my game and it all paid off as we were three time state champs from my sophomore year to my senior year. I also had various
    individual accomplishments such as being in the starting six all four years, most improved during my freshman season, and best spare shooter during
    my sophomore season. At tournaments: I placed 1st at the Pepsi tournament during my sophomore year, I placed 21st at the 2022 High School Nationals
    Singles Tournament, and I placed 7th in singles at the 2023 High School State Tournament. Throughout my four years, I usually averaged around 203
    during practice season and around 206 for the actual season.
